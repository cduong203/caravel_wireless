Wireless Energy Harvesting:
Energy harvesting is becoming increasingly more popular and common to service the many portable and wearable devices utilized by consumers today. Benefits of improving wireless energy harvesting systems include extending the battery life between charges and also decreasing the battery size and overall device form factor. This project is a simple Dickson rectifier configuration using the standard 1.8V NMOS transistors in the skywater130 pdk. One, two, and three-stage rectifiers have been implemented and are aimed to be applied in an 18 MHz system implementing passive voltage boosting techniques.
